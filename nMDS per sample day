## and now plot

  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1, 5, 22)) +
  theme(legend.key.size=unit(0.3,"cm")) +
  theme_bw() 
P

# label each point with time. Put colour=control
# as want all these labels in black text, otherwise looks messy.
# play with hjust and vjust to move text around
# h just moves text left to right ( left bigger the number)

P2 <- P +geom_text(aes(label=time, colour="Control"),hjust=0.45, vjust=0.3, 
                   size=4, fontface = "bold") 

P2 + labs(shape="Phase", colour="Treatment") + # update legend titles.
  # change legend icon size for Treatment
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size=7))) + 
  # change legend icon size for phase
  guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size=6))) +
  # change spacing of legend icons. 
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(1.8,"line"))


# done. Play with export dims to get best. I found around 1200 width
# was good but it depends how big you made points in the end.
