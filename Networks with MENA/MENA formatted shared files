##  MENA formatted shared files

## MENA pipline (for molecular ecology network analysis) 
## requires tab delimited text files where
## samples are the columns, not rows. IE mothur shared
## files need to transformed. 

## Import subsampled otu matrix (17768 seqs - is what was done in sub.sample)

sharedsubFile = read.table('stability.an.0.03.subsample.shared')
sharedsubFile = t(sharedsubFile)        # transform
rownames(sharedsubFile) = sharedsubFile[,1]
colnames(sharedsubFile) = sharedsubFile[2,]
sharedsubFile = sharedsubFile[,2:48]    # define col no's
sharedsubFile = sharedsubFile[4:17770,] # define row no's use # from sub.sample + 1
class(sharedsubFile) <- "numeric"
head(sharedsubFile)

# read it out 

write.csv(sharedsubFile, file='sharedsubFile.csv')

# if you want to do network of all your treatments in one go, 
## then open this file in excel, put 'ID' as header of column1
# then save it as tab delimited .txt file
# now it's ready for MENA

## if you want to split your shared file to make separate
## networks for each treatment then read this csv back in as below
## and choose the appropriate column names to make separate otu tables for each
## treatment. These are then read out. 

yy <- read.csv("sharedsubFile.csv", header = TRUE, row.names=1)

# Treatment1 is samples in columns 1 - 15 incl.
ElongDNAsub = yy[,1:15]

write.csv(ElongDNAsub, file='ElongDNAsub.csv')

# Treatment2 is samples in columns 16 - 31 incl.
HeadingDNAsub = yy[,16:31]

write.csv(HeadingDNAsub, file='HeadingDNAsub.csv')

# Treatment3 is samples in columns 32 - 47 incl.
RipenDNAsub = yy[,32:47]

write.csv(RipenDNAsub, file='RipenDNAsub.csv')

## now open each of these in excel
## check 'ID' as column 1 name
## then save as tab delimited text file (must be this or won't work on pipeline)
## now it's ready for MENA pipeline
