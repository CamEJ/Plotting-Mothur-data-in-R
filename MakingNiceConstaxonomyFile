## some bits for working with default ; separated taxonomy information eg in biom tables or constaxonomy table

# first, if i have biomfile i get df with just otu ID as var1 and taxonomy as var2
# in this example, the df is called 'taxa'

# first I get rid of " using gsub
taxa$taxonomy = gsub('"', '', taxa$taxonomy)


#taxa$nice = as.data.frame(gsub("\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)","",as.character(taxa$Taxonomy)))
# then get rid of anything of brackets (eg mothur gives percent of how many were from that, like (100) )
taxa$nice = gsub("\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)","",taxa$taxonomy)

head(taxa)
# now split into columns - my otu table 6 levels, so i split and give names of my new vars
MyPrettyDF = taxa %>% separate(nice, c("Kingdom", "Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus"), ";")
